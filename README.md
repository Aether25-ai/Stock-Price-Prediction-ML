# Stock-Price-Prediction-ML- (using Linear Regression)

## 📈 Project Overview
Forecasting stock prices is a difficult task for researchers and analysts. This project implements a **Linear Regression** model to predict market directions for Google (GOOGL) or any other preffered stock. Because investors are highly interested in stock price prediction for successful investments, this system provides supportive information to help visualize market trends from 2024 to 2026.

## 🧠 Model Description: How it Works
This project uses **Supervised Learning** to identify the linear relationship between time and price.

* ]**Objective**: To help traders, investors, and analysts by providing future directions of the stock market.
* **Data Transformation**: Converts chronological dates into numerical indices to calculate the "Line of Best Fit."
* **Algorithm**: Linear Regression ($y = mx + c$), which calculates the optimal trendline through the 2024-2025 data to forecast the start of 2026.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Real-Time Data**: Automatically fetches historical data via `yfinance`.
* **Time-Series Visualization**: A customized X-axis showing actual months and years for better readability.
* Future Situations**: Helps investors know the future situation of the market to facilitate better investment decisions.
